## Mappings between variables as coded in Qualtrics and as they appear in Results_TidyClean.tsv.txt

Of the variables in Results_TidyClean.tsv.txt that were involved in the analyses in the paper, the variable names and their interpretation should be clear from the accompanying R file and its output. 

However, before these R analyses were completed, some variables were assigned unintuitive codes by Qualtrics and had to be remapped. For example, selecting "1" as the answer to the question "How many adults (including you) are in your household?" caused a '4' to be recorded in the Adults-in-House column; this had to then be remapped to '1' in the Adults-in-House-Value column. This remapping was done by the code in analysis_genetics1.

The remainder of this file details all cases where the numeric code assigned to an answer by Qualtrics differs from the actual answer - either because of a non-intuitive numeric mapping as described in the previous paragraph, or because the user selected an answer to a multiple-choice question that Qualtrics mapped to a numeric value. They are shown below in the format:

NOTE: For questions 1-13 of the modified Scheuner et al. scale, responses 1 through 4 corresponded to Qualtrics codes of 1 through 4; therefore no remapping was necessary
